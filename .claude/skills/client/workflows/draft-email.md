# Draft Client Email

## Steps

1. **Find the client file**
   
   Look in `Clients/` for the matching client name.

2. **Read context**
   
   From the client file, gather:
   - Who they are (company, role)
   - Recent interactions (from Notes section)
   - What action is needed (`next_action_note`)
   - Last contact date

3. **Draft personalized email**
   
   Write an email that:
   - References previous interaction
   - Addresses the specific action needed
   - Is brief and actionable
   - Matches the user's communication style (check CLAUDE.md)

4. **Present draft**
   
   Show the draft and ask:
   - "Ready to send?"
   - "Want me to adjust anything?"

## Example

**Input:** "Draft follow-up email to Sarah"

**Output:**
```

Hi Sarah,

Hope you had a good week. Following up on the automation proposal 
I sent over last week.

Any questions I can answer? Happy to jump on a quick call if that 
would help.

Best,

Ready to send, or want me to adjust anything?
