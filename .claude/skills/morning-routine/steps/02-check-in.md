# Morning Check-in

## Task

Ask the user reflection questions and create today's check-in note.

## Questions

Ask these one at a time, conversationally:

1. **How are you feeling this morning?** (mood, energy 1-10)
2. **How did you sleep?** (quality 1-10, hours)
3. **What's your main focus for today?**
4. **What would make today feel successful?**
5. **Any ideas or thoughts to capture?**

## Create Note

After responses, create `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD. Morning Check-in.md`:

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
mood: [their answer]
energy: [1-10]
sleep_quality: [1-10]
