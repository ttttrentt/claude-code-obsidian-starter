# Setup Memory

Help the user build their CLAUDE.md file.

## Process

1. **Ask these questions:**

   - What do you do? (job, role, main activity)
   - What are you working on? (main projects)
   - How do you prefer to communicate? (formal/casual, brief/detailed)
   - Any preferences for how I should work?

2. **Generate CLAUDE.md:**

```markdown
# About Me

[Their role/activity]

## Current Focus

[Their projects]

## Communication Style

[Their preferences]

## How to Work With Me

[Their working preferences]

## This Vault

- Projects/ = active projects
- Clients/ = client profiles
- Tasks/ = task management
- Daily/ = daily notes
```

3. **Write to CLAUDE.md**

4. **Confirm:** "Your memory is set up! I'll read this every session."
