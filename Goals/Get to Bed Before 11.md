# Get to Bed Before 11

Improve sleep consistency for better morning energy.

## Why This Matters

Late nights compound into poor mornings. When I sleep before 11, I wake up naturally around 7 feeling refreshed.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] In bed by 10:45pm
- [ ] Phone in another room
- [ ] 7+ hours sleep logged

## Progress Log

### 2025-12-13
Bed at 10:30. Woke up at 6:45 without alarm.

### 2025-12-11
Slipped to 11:30 - was watching YouTube. Need to set phone boundary earlier.
