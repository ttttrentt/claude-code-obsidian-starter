# Exercise 5 Times a Week

Maintain consistent physical activity to support energy and mental clarity.

## Why This Matters

Exercise directly impacts my focus and mood. When I skip workouts, I notice lower energy by mid-afternoon.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 5 workouts per week
- [ ] Mix of cardio and strength
- [ ] Track in morning check-ins

## Progress Log

### 2025-12-12
Strength training - upper body. Need to increase weights next time.
